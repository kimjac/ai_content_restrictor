WordPress plugin that crawls sources for categorized content, restricts certain content using AI, and allows pre-defined restrictions by an administrator, you would need to leverage several tools.

This could involve:

Web Scraping Libraries: To crawl external websites and categorize content.

AI/ML Integration: Use an AI-based API for image/text classification (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, Azure Content Moderator).

Admin Panel for Pre-Defined Rules: Build a settings page for the administrator to define restrictions.

WordPress Hooks: Utilize WordPress hooks and filters to control content publication.How the Plugin Works:

Admin Settings: Admins can set content categories they wish to restrict in the WordPress dashboard.

Crawling Content: The plugin crawls content from external sources via a URL (in this case, using wp_remote_get()).

AI Classification: The plugin calls a mock AI service to classify the crawled content into categories.

Content Restriction: The plugin compares the classified categories with the admin-defined restricted categories.

Auto Publishing: If the content is not restricted, it is published automatically.

Key Technologies:
wp_remote_get(): Used to fetch content from external URLs.

AI API: You can integrate a real AI API (e.g., Google Cloud Vision or Microsoft Azure Content Moderator).
wp_schedule_event(): Schedules the crawling process at regular intervals.

Notes:
External API: In the example, a mock AI API is used. You'll need to replace it with an actual AI service like Google Cloud Vision, OpenAI API, or other content moderation APIs.
Customization: You can extend this plugin to handle images, video content, or even more complex admin configurations.
